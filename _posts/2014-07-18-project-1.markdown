description: In this project, I used R language. First, I have taken a dataset with all the earthquake occured details and then implemented the data mining algorithms like decision tree, k-means clustering, Naive base classification and Random Forest algorithm. And later from the outputs I calculate OOB error perdiction and prediction accuracy.
